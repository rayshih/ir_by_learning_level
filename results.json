Here’s a list of the 10 best web development tutorials for beginners.1. CodecademyIt’s almost like a university course, only you control when and where class happens. Codecademy’s beginning web development course walks you through the basics of HTML and CSS, giving you projects throughout to practice newly learned skills. And once you’ve mastered the fundamentals, it’s easy to launch into a new course on a more specialized skill, such as PHP, JavaScript or Python.2. HTML Dog’s Beginning HTML GuideThis set of tutorials is much less flashy than Codecademy, but just as useful. HTML Dog provides a straightforward, easy-to-follow group of tutorials covering HTML fundamentals. If you’re interested in learning CSS or JavaScript, they’ve got beginner’s guides for those as well.3. Ruby on Rails TutorialOne of the most popular web development frameworks, Ruby on Rails—based on the Ruby language—powers Basecamp, Twitter and GitHub, just to name a few.

Covering more than just Rails, you’ll also learn the ins and out of web application development.4. Mozilla Developer NetworkFrom the folks behind the Firefox browser comes this helpful list of web development tutorials. Focused on HTML, CSS and JavaScript, tutorials run the gamut of beginner to advanced.5. PHP 101 for the Absolute BeginnerThis popular scripting language is not just one of those fleeting web development trends (Flash, anyone?); it’s here to stay, and has long been used for server-side programming on a large number of websites. If you’ve been itching to learn it, start here with Zend’s free tutorials. They’re easy to understand and will have you writing code in no time.6. GitHub for BeginnersGitHub is the de facto collaboration tool for many software development projects. If you want to work in web development, familiarity with GitHub is a must. This tutorial is a great way to learn the ins, outs and terminology that make the networking site tick. And like the title says, this tutorial truly is for beginners—no prior programming experience is required.7. Non-Programmer's Tutorial to Python 3One of the top 8 programming languages, Python is often used as a scripting language for web apps. This tutorial will help you master the basics of Python, but more importantly, you’ll master the fundamentals of programming in the process.8. 30 Days to Learn jQueryjQuery is an open-source JavaScript library, designed to simplify the job of client-side scripting. If you’re looking to use it in web development, check out this tutorial—30 days worth of 10- to 15-minute lessons from Tuts+ will get you started on the road to being a jQuery ninja.9. A Roadmap for Beginning to CodeAs author Jimmy Li states in his intro, “You don’t know what you don’t know.” Well, with this big-picture tutorial on beginning web development, you’ll quickly learn what you need to know and how to get there. It’s a great read before jumping into anything else.10. Coding Pitfalls for BeginnersRead this last tutorial after you’ve spent time learning your chosen web development frameworks.

However, despite the fact that I spent most of my adult life working for some Internet and software companies (in their account management teams), I found the idea of coding a webpage extremely daunting and lumped HTML together with just about every programming language out there.However, while going through a career transition last year, I decided it was time to learn some web development skills and spent $199 on Victor Bastos’ “Become A Web Developer From Scratch” course on Udemy. The course covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as introductions to PHP, MYSQL, AJAX, JSON, XML, and JQuery (way more than I needed!).In the first few weeks, I breezed through HTML and realized just how easy a language it was to understand and implement. At age 33, I wondered why I hadn’t done this sooner.  While I decided to pay some money for some training with a seasoned expert, I realized afterwards that much of the information I learned is just scattered across the web, and those who are really driven can learn basic HTML for free.I have scoured the web and found the best free beginner HTML tutorial sites to make it a little bit easier for you. That was no easy task, as HTML tutorials like the one you see below are a dime a dozen. In the course of our research, we found almost 200 sites similar to the ones you see below.Do you really want an HTML tutorial from a Web 1.0 site?Where Not To StartW3Schools is a massive wiki on HTML. If you Google anything related to HTML, chances are it will come up in the top of your search researchs — maybe in the top three spots simultaneously! While some of the info maybe useful, it is generally disregarded as a sham amongst experienced developers. W3Schools is not at all an HTML expert tutorial site. It is however, an expert in search engine optimization (SEO), which has managed to rank high for hundreds if not thousands of HTML-related keywords. This dominant position in online searches allows W3Schools to make money off of unsuspecting web surfers seeking HTML tutorials, who end up on the site just to click ads. Worse, some site visitors end up purchasing a W3Schools certification. In fact, a site called W3Fools has been set up as a crusade to inform people of the folly of using this site for help. So proceed with caution at W3Schools. While some of the information may be useful, it is not always accurate.Buyer beware of W3SchoolsThe Primo StuffUsually, everyone likes to save the best for last but let’s not waste any time. Here, you’ll find two things: the very best tutorials and the very best interactive coding tutorial platforms, the latter hinting at how HTML, CSS, and web design languages will be learned in the future. What can be better than coding what you are simultaneously learning and watching code render into a web page, live before your eyes?Codeacadamy is one of a few great free places to start learning web development.Code Academy is an education company that provides free interactive programming lessons on various topics, such as HTML, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP and Python. You must sign in with an account but all resources are free.Code Avengers is a provider of interactive online tutorials that teach visitors how to code games, apps and websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They offer three levels of interactive courses on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with more coming in January 2014.Shay Howe’s “A Practical Guide to HTML & CSS,” is a simple and comprehensive guide dedicated to helping beginners learn HTML and CSS, covering all of the fundamentals. This guide covers all common elements of front-end design and development. Once completed, you can move on to the advanced guide.Mozilla Webmaker is a an interactive toolset for beginners with two useful and fun tools: Thimble and X-ray Goggles. Thimble is an interactive code editor similar to what you’d get in Code Academy but you can run any code you find in any of the tutorials on this page. X-ray Goggles lets you inspect and change code on any webpage you surf. Webmaker also comes with a bunch of templates you can ‘remix’ and share.Site Point is a respected web development and programming publishing house that has been around since the late 90′s. They’ve published a number of great books and have a treasure trove of tutorials, books, articles, and even courses via their private course platform, Learnable.The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community where member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. Led by Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C’s mission is to lead the Web to its full potential. It is the top authority on HTML and has plenty of suitable learning materials.Solid ResourcesThese stylishly designed websites demonstrate that they are developed and maintained by experts. These websites provide basic, intermediate and web tutorials, including those on CSS for people wanting to learn more about the design aspects of a webpage. Some of these sites focus solely on the newer web language versions — HTML5 and CSS3 — which are essentially the same languages, but improved to support for better-looking webpages and faster browsing. Those who are serious about a career in web design should not merely gloss over HTML5 and CSS3, as these are the future of web and application development.The Tuts+ Network is one of many reputable sites that provide high quality HTML tutorials.activejump is a smart-wiki tutorial page for HTML and CSS. Navigate quickly between different topics, read instructions or grab snippets of HTML code.Channel 9 is a video blog by Microsoft employees that demonstrates the latest trends in technology, and provides educational resources on programming and on using Microsoft services. This HTML5 course is a 21-episode series that teaches the fundamentals of HTML5 and CSS3.HTML Dog has step-by-step guides and tutorials on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript broken up into beginner, intermediate, and advanced categories. The guides are easy to follow and easy to read.HTML5-Tutorial is a no frills tutorial for absolute beginners in HTML and HTML5. It covers the basics and aims to provide the necessary skills to develop basic webpages, and when and how to use HTML5.Mozilla Developer Network is a daily updated wiki that offers web development articles for beginners and advanced users. The site is easy to navigate and contains guides, tutorials, and articles on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and advanced concepts of web development.TutsPlus is a mammoth tutorial network with almost 5K articles on HTML-related activities alone, many of which come with downloadable project files.Web Design Library is a blog and mish-mash of all sorts of web design tutorials. It’s a little heavy on advertising, but actually has a lot of good tutorial content.Web Platform is a community site that strives to be a thorough and respected resource for web developer documentation and related concerns. It has tutorials, blogs, and a community forum.W3resource is a large and frequently updated tutorial wiki-site. It contains tutorials in many different subjects for beginners to advanced students, complete with code snippets.Cures for What Ails YouThese websites have a little bit of everything and go beyond the simple building blocks of HTML. They are for HTML learning journeymen who are looking for many perspectives on their craft and need answers to the problems they face with current projects. There is a plethora of information here for curious beginners.Stack Overflow is the go-to resource for any programmer. While it’s not a tutorial per se, beginners who want to become front-end developers will find a ton of useful information here.Front End Rescue is a curated list of people, places, newsletters, websites, and podcasts, all of which are singularly focused on great web design and development. It’s definitely developed for more advanced learners but something worth bookmarking and coming back to when you are ready to kick it up a notch.Move The Web Forward is a another massive single-page curated learning resource list that highlights the best web development and design resources on the Internet, with content for learners of all levels.webdevRefinery is a specialized web development community and forum with over 16K members. It’s got content for beginners to experts and is a great place to discuss web development related issues with peers who are going through the same experiences.Stack Overflow is the mother of all programming forums. If you have any question you can probably find a thread about it there. Get feedback from seasoned developers and partake in conversations to help refine your craft. There is a mini-site just for HTML coding.You Get What You Pay ForThere’s a ton of free beginner HTML tutorials out there and many of them (even the spammy ones) will help you gain a cursory understanding of the fundamentals of HTML and how to build a webpage. You can visit a handful of these pages and cobble together a reasonable education. However, with a few exceptions, these guides are static web pages with the simplest of text examples. To truly understand HTML and put it in practice require the same elements you’d find in a college chemistry class: a good teacher to guide you through stumbling blocks, a thoughtful discussion around the topic, and most importantly, a live project that allows you to see how your HTML code renders in a browser. Even the best of free tutorial sites fall short of that. The good news is that for a small investment (~$25/month), you can get all of the above. In fact, once you’ve got the basics down from the free sites, it may be the only way to transform your HTML skills from good to great. Once you are ready to step up to the next level, Treehouse is probably the best value in paid training. However, if you are looking to step it up a notch and get really good, you’ll need the tutelage of seasoned front-end developers, which you can find via Thinkful or a coding bootcamp.

Photo: Ariel Zambelich/Wired.com﻿[Editor's note: The following is a guest post from Igor Faletski, CEO of Mobify, which provides tools for adapting web sites for smartphones and tablets.]You’ve probably heard people say we’re living in a “post-PC world.” What does that mean for web developers? It means that 30% to 50% of your website’s traffic now comes from mobile devices. It means that soon, desktop and laptop users will be in a minority on the web. How do we deal with this tectonic shift in user behavior? We’ve moved beyond the era of m-dot or t-dot hacks, into one where responsive and adaptive design techniques rule the day — what the W3C calls a One Web approach. The key part of the W3C’s recommendation is that “One Web means making, as far as is reasonable, the same information and services available to users irrespective of the device they are using.”For developers that means that taking a One Web approach ensures that not only does your site work on the smartphones and tablets of today, but it can be future-proofed for the unimagined screens of tomorrow.There are currently three popular approaches to developing a One Web site: using a responsive design; client-side adaptive designs; and server-side adaptive designs. One is not better or worse than the other; each has its own strengths and weaknesses and the wise web developer will consider the benefits and drawbacks of each before picking the one that works for their next project.Responsive Web DesignResponsive web design is the most common One Web approach. The approach uses CSS media queries to modify the presentation of a website based on the size of the device display. The number of responsive sites is rapidly increasing, from the Boston Globe to Disney to Indochino. A key advantage of this approach is that designers can use a single template for all devices, and just use CSS to determine how content is rendered on different screen sizes. Plus, those designers can still work in HTML and CSS, technologies they’re already familiar with. Additionally, there’s a growing number of responsive-friendly, open-source toolkits like Bootstrap or Foundation which help simplify the process of building responsive sites. On the other hand, there are few shortcuts to a sound responsive design. To go responsive, organizations often have to undertake a complete site rebuild. The design and testing phase can be quite fussy, as it can be difficult to customize the user experience for every possible device or context. We’ve all seen responsive site layouts that look like a bunch of puzzle pieces that don’t quite fit together. Responsive web design works best in combination with a mobile-first approach, where the mobile use case is prioritized during development. Progressive enhancement is then used to address tablet and desktop use cases.Performance can also be a bugbear for responsive sites. At Mobify, we recently completed an analysis of 15 popular responsive e-commerce sites. Among these sites, the home pages loaded an average of 87 resources and 1.9 MB of data. Some responsive pages were as big as 15MB.The numbers are that high because a responsive approach covers all devices. Your user is only using one device, but they have to wait for all of the page elements and resources to load before they can use it. Put simply, performance affects your bottom line. On smartphones, the conversion rate drops by an extra 3.5 percent when users have to wait just one second. By the three second mark, 57 percent of users will have left your site completely.While responsive design is fast becoming the de facto standard, it also creates new challenges for online businesses, including how to handle images, how to optimize mobile performance and often means sites need to be rebuilt from the ground up with a mobile first approach.Client-Side AdaptiveAdaptive design builds on the principles of responsive design to deliver user experiences that are targeted at specific devices and contexts. It uses JavaScript to enrich websites with advanced functionality and customization. For example, adaptive websites deliver Retina-quality images only to Retina displays (such as the new iPad) while standard-definition displays receive lower-quality images. There are two approaches to adaptive design — one where the adaptations occur on the client side, in the user’s browser, and another where the web server does the heavy lifting of detecting various devices and loading the correct template. Examples of client-side adaptive sites include Threadless and ideeli. One of the strengths of the adaptive templating approach is the ability to reuse one set of HTML and JavaScript across devices, simplifying change management and testing.A client-side adaptive approach means you don’t have to rebuild your site from the ground up. Instead you can build on existing content while still delivering a mobile-responsive layout. For expert developers, this approach also enables you to specifically target particular devices or screen resolutions. For example, for many of Mobify’s online fashion retail clients, 95% of their mobile traffic comes from iPhones. Client-side adaptive means they can optimize specifically for Apple smartphones. Unlike responsive design, adaptive templates ensure that only the required resources are loaded by the client’s device. Because device and feature detection is shifted to the mobile device itself, CDN networks like Akamai and Edgecast can use most of their caching functionality without disrupting the user experience.The client-side adaptive approach has a higher barrier to entry than responsive design. Developers need to have a solid grasp of JavaScript to use this technique. It also depends on a site’s existing templates as the foundation. Finally, because the client-side adaptations are a kind of layer on top of your existing code base, you need to maintain them as your site as a whole evolves. Server-Side AdaptiveWe can achieve the server-side adaptive approach in a variety of ways, through server-side plugins and custom user agent detection. Sites that use server-side adaptive include Etsy, One Kings Lane and OnlineShoes.com.Why choose server-side adaptive? It typically offers distinct templates for each devices, enabling more customization, and it keeps device-detection logic on the server, enabling smaller mobile pages that load faster. Additionally, there are numerous server-side plugins available for common CMSs and eCommerce systems such as Magento.This approach isn’t for the faint of heart–it typically requires significant changes to your back-end systems, which can result in a lengthy (and costly) implementation. The requirement to manage multiple templates raises ongoing maintenance costs. Finally, this approach can encounter performance issues when servers are under heavy load. When mobile user agent detection is performed on the server, a lot of common caching mechanisms deployed by CDNs like Akamai need to be turned off. This can result in a slower user experience for mobile and desktop visitors.Of course, many companies are still wrestling with the basics of responsive, and they’re not ready to confront the more sophisticated flavors of adaptive. Increasingly, competition and mobile traffic, however, will drive more and more organizations to kick the tires on all three approaches, and pick the one that works best for their users.

Image: Screenshot/WebmonkeyMicrosoft’s Internet Explorer 10 saw a meteoric rise in market share last month, jumping from 2.93 percent in March to 6.22 percent in April, according to NetMarketShare. Some of IE 10′s growth might be attributable to more Windows 8 machines coming online, but it also comes close on the heels of the release of Internet Explorer 10 for Windows 7. As we noted in our review, IE 10 is a huge step forward for Microsoft’s oft-maligned browser, bringing much better web standards support and considerable speed improvements over IE 9. And there’s plenty to like even on Windows 7 where Microsoft claims users should see a 20 percent increase in performance over IE 9, as well as better battery life on Windows 7 laptops.While web developers should be happy to see IE 10 gaining some ground given its vastly superior web standards support and speed compared to previous releases, looking at the bigger browser share picture is still disheartening. While IE 10 use may have doubled last month, it still trails IE 6 use worldwide. The most widely used version of IE on the web remains IE 8, which, while much better than IE 6, still has next to no support for modern web development tools like HTML5 and CSS 3. As always, progressive enhancement and feature-detection tools like Modernizr are your friends when it comes to older versions of IE.

It’s still in the early stages, but WebRTC has the potential to supplant Skype, Flash and many native apps with web-based alternatives that work on any device.Codassium uses WebRTC to bring together WebRTC-based video chat and Mozilla’s Ace code editor. The result is what Wreally Studios, creators of Codassium, call “a better way to conduct remote interviews.” Of course Codassium could be used for more than just interviews — think code reviews, remote pair programming or even just discussing code with remote employees.To use Codassium you’ll need to be using a web browser that supports WebRTC — recent versions of Firefox and Chrome will both work. Head on over to Codassium, click the Start button and allow the site to access your camera and microphone. Once the video chat and Ace editor load, just click the Invite button and send the resulting link to the person you’d like to work with.

By Scott Gilbertson                                                    The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine is deceptively simple — plug in a website and you can see copies of it over time. What you don’t see is the massive amount of effort, data and storage necessary to capture and maintain those archives. Filmmaker Jonathan Minard’s documentary Internet Archive takes a behind the scenes look at how (and why) the Internet Archive’s efforts are preserving the web as we know it.The interview with Brewster Kahle, founder of the Internet Archive, especially offers a look at not just the idea behind the archive, but the actual servers that hold the 10 petabytes of archived websites, books, movies, music, and television broadcasts that the Internet Archive currently stores.

Image: CERN.Twenty years ago today CERN published a statement that made the World Wide Web freely available to everyone. To celebrate that moment in history, CERN is bringing the very first website back to life at its original URL.If you’d like to see the very first webpage Tim Berners-Lee and the WWW team ever put online, point your browser to http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html. For years now that URL has simply redirected to the root info.cern.ch site. But, because we all know cool URIs don’t change, CERN has brought it back to life. Well, sort of anyway. The site has been reconstructed from an archive hosted on the W3C site, so what you’re seeing is a 1992 copy of the first website. Sadly this is, thus far, the earliest copy anyone can find, though the team at CERN is hoping to turn up an older copy.Be sure to view the source of the first webpage. You’ll find quite a few things about early HTML that have long since changed — like the use of <HEADER> instead of <HEAD> or the complete absence of a root <HTML> tag. There’s also a trace of Berners-Lee’s famous NeXT machine in the <NEXTID N=\"55\"> tag.CERN has big plans for the original website, starting with bringing the rest of the pages back online. “Then we will look at the first web servers at CERN and see what assets from them we can preserve and share,” writes CERN’s Dan Noyes. “We will also sift through documentation and try to restore machine names and IP addresses to their original state.”In the mean time, have a look at the web’s original todo list and read more about the project to restore the first website over on Mark Boulton’s blog.

Whether you work internal to a company, as a freelance developer, or just for your own network of sites, eventually the 80/20 rule hits you. You know, the one that has many corollaries, but in this case means \"80% of the work you do on websites is virtually the same stuff, over and over again\".Wouldn't it be nice instead to let someone else do much of that work and support, and save your pounding brain for the creative stuff that's different every time? That thought hit me a few years ago, when I realized that even though all my websites were entirely different, I could design, code, and maintain them all with an open-source Content Management System (CMS). I did some serious research, such as implementing one website using PHP-Nuke, Mambo, Joomla, and finally WordPress.I chose WordPress as my general-purpose framework, even though it's theoretically a blogging platform, for a number of reasons. First of all, it's backed by a company, yet still has a large number of independent contributors. This is probably the best way of keeping code up to date and viable commercially, while still using the Open Source model. New features, bug fixes, and security patches are thus released relatively often, and it doesn't hurt that you can now update WordPress with a single click. Secondly, there are a phenomenal number of freely available, high quality themes and plugins that allow you to easily customize not only the look and feel, but also the functionality of your WordPress site. Finally, the total interoperability of WordPress with other platforms is second to none, so your site will be able to handle everything from Google Maps to SEO to AdSense to iPhone capability from day one. Don't believe it? That's why I'm here to teach you how to do it all.Let's start with the basics. You can set up a WordPress blog free, but since you're a developer, you want a WordPress-based website, not simply a blog. At minimum, you'll need access to a web server with PHP 4.3 and MySQL 4.1.2, and then you just download the code, edit one configuration file, and upload it to your server. I've heard a lot of software companies make outlandish claims, but believe me, the WordPress people are not exaggerating...when they talk about \"five-minute installation\", they are actually leaving you an extra 3 or 4 minutes for coffee! Using a web hosting provider that supports cPanel makes things even easier (once you know your way around cPanel, that is), but if you know the database login information for MySQL on your server, you're pretty much already done.Once you've successfully installed WordPress, make sure you copy the admin account login name and password (they will even generate a good one for you). You'll first find yourself at the Dashboard:Most of the functions and technical menus are on the left sidebar. Explore the user interface a bit. WordPress comes with a single sample blog post (Posts/Edit); you should add a few more, not just to get the feel of how it's done, but also to fill up the page with text and posts, so that you'll better be able to see how different themes change the look of the page.And \"page\" is the key word here, because pages are the secret key to getting WordPress to do what you want (assuming you want more than just a blog). Using the WordPress page feature, you can create and name static pages easily--using either the built-in WYSIWYG editor or raw HTML--while remaining within the WordPress framework with all of its advantages.Once you've created some posts and pages (use Lorem Ipsum if you're in a hurry), you can proceed to finding yourself a nice theme. As I mentioned in a previous article, you can save a lot of time when picking themes by deciding what function you want the theme to serve. There are themes already optimized for things like photo galleries, e-commerce, and SEO, so search for tags or keywords that will help you do what you want. WordPress even has a new search interface for this very purpose. And when you do get a list of possible themes, take a careful look at how well other users rated them, because that will give you a good hint of how much trouble people had trying to use them!                                                                                                                var blurbKey = 5619960;                Make a Comment        Loading Comments...

We are going all out to help you hone your skills in manipulating those codes to respond at will when displayed on different devices. And to do this, we are featuring 30 Responsive Web Design Tutorials found online. This list is not meant to be an exhaustive one but it will get you started on understanding the basics of designing an adaptive website that will cater to all sorts of screen sizes.We’ll start off with introductory tutorials in ‘Breaking the Ice’, something like an RWD: 101 class you should attend to get the hang of the concept before we move on to ‘Start Building’ exercises.Lastly we’ll end with a ‘Do More’ section in which we’ll feature tutorials that play with horizontal layouts, ‘elastic’ videos, drop-down menus and slide-to-top accordion navigations, thumbnails and the sticky issue with tables.But first…Here’s a recap of the two tutorials that were featured earlier this week by our authors:Responsive website Navigation By Thoriq Firdaus  – [View tutorial]Here’s a tutorial to help you make your very own responsive website navigation.

You need some knowledge of CSS to understand it..Designing For A Responsive WebBy Max Luzuriaga – [View tutorial]Here’s an article that is not so much a tutorial as it is a guide to creating responsive web design. That said, the author literally tells you the do’s and don’ts of responsive web design. There are explanations about why certain features are not responsive enough, how to work with proportions and modules, and best of all, it is relatively short and easy to absorb.Responsive Web Design: A Visual GuideBy Andrew Gormley – [View tutorial]If text-filled tutorials are not viable options, try this video tutorial instead. It is still rather technical but if it makes you feel better, you don’t have to do much reading. It’s about 25 minutes long and the video-maker actually fast-fowarded through the parts where he codes, then goes back to explain what the codes do.Start Building Alright, let’s start building some responsive designs, starting with…Fluid GridsBy Ethan Marcotte – [View tutorial]Say grid, and you would think ‘rigid structures’, say fluid and you’d think that it could flow from one side of the screen to the bottom or top or side when you apply pressure to the browser, but put those two together and you would probably think you need to look at this tutorial to fully appreciate how fluid grids can help make your design more responsive.Fluid ImagesBy Ethan Marcotte – [View tutorial]By the end of this article, you should know who Ethan Marcotte is. Here’s a hint: he is the one who came up with the concept and term for web responsive designs. His name will pretty much turn up in every other tutorial in this list so why not take advice about fluid images straight from the Master himself?.Scalable Navigation Patterns in Responsive Web DesignBy Michael Mesker – [View tutorial]This tutorial talks about the lessons the author learned from a working on a large-scale responsive web design project.

We've also included the Typography section because it's been a rage among pros out there. And this trend isn't going anywhere any time soon.In the CMS section, you can find a bunch of practical and easy-to-follow tutorials on how to work with WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. You'll learn not only how to use your CMS but also how to customize it as you see fit and improve for better performance.Another huge section is Photoshop and that's for a reason because you can't be an expert without getting to grips with the industry standard image editor. If you pay close attention to the section and learn just about everything, you'll be able to take up virtually any design-related job because we offer Photoshop tutorials and articles both for beginners and pros. Plus if you really want to be in the know, you can check our Vector Graphics section, which really comes into play if you're in the logo creation business.In case you feel like doing some animation masterpieces, we got you covered as well. You can find in-depth articles and tutorials on Flash, Swish, and 3D graphics in the respective sections.Being a skillful pro, you definitely need to know at least the basics of both HTML and CSS. You'll find this sort of tutorials in the HTML and CSS section on our site. You'll be able to learn everything about these disciplines from top to bottom.Other than that, you can learn how to do web programming with the help of PHP, ASP, and JavaScript. While creating the stuff for the section, we did realize that you may be wanting to start from the very beginning and that's exactly why we made sure that the tutorials may also bring you from zero to hero. So the bottom line is that you can learn how to create an amazing work of art and actually make it work as a full-fledged web site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         jQuery(window).load(function() {    $('#popup_banner').popupBanner({        headerURL: '/images/popup/top_18.png?1403231625',        headerHoverURL: '/images/popup/top_hover_18.png',        headerDestURL: '/templates/',        imageURL: '/images/popup/2_18.jpg',        destURL: '',        footerURL: '/images/popup/bottom_18.png',        footerHoverURL: '/images/popup/bottom_hover_18.png',        footerDestURL: 'http://www.templatetuning.com/?aff=wdl',        isHeader: 0,        isFooter: 0,        isClose: 0,        isRollUp: 0,        showTime: 7,        pageId: '2_18',        templateType: 0,        marginTop: 0,        aff: 'wdl',        banner_width: 170,        banner_height: 187,        show: 1});            $(\"#popup_banner_top, #banner_link_center, #popup_banner_bottom\").live('click',function() {            var url = 'http://www.webdesign.org/';            switch ($(this).attr('id')) {            case 'popup_banner_top'   : _gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Clicks on Header', url]);            break;            case 'banner_link_center' : _gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Clicks on Banner', url]);            break;            case 'popup_banner_bottom': _gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Clicks on Footer', url]);            break;            }            _gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Popup Engagement', url]);            });        });  var _gaq = _gaq || [];  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-2347512-1']);  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);  _gaq.push(['_trackPageLoadTime']);  (function() {    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Designing web sites is a highly creative process and it is not easy at all to get started if you do not have the right ideas, inspiration, skills and tools available. One thing is to get the idea or falling in love with a design used on some web site you run into. Turning the idea into a concrete design, e.g. a nicely layered and structured PSD ready to be sliced can be quite a challenge unless you have years of experience. One of the best ways to get started is to learn from others having enough experience and passion to share their techniques and ways of working in detailed tutorials. Great thanks to all the Photoshop Web Design Tutorial creators – keep up the great work! It is also important to master text effects in tools like Photoshop when creating advanced designs.

Vertical is the natural flow of web layout. When page elements reach the right edge of the browser window and go over, the flow defaults to “wrapping” that element down onto the next line. The more content on the page, the taller it gets, not the wider. Why is this? Because it just makes sense. Our eyes are used to reading fairly short lines of text, so if we were to see a paragraph of text in one long straight line, it would be painful to read. Paragraphs need to have line breaks in them to be readable (hence the term “blocks” of text). We sure as heck don’t want to hard-code line breaks into the markup ourselves. Obviously, we don’t have to, the browser does this wrapping for us. Thus the vertical expansion.Vibrant Modern Blog Design in PhotoshopThis tutorial will cover the process of designing a vibrant and colourful modern blog layout in Adobe Photoshop.Tutorial Site Blog DesignIn this tutorial you will learn how to make a sleek, and professional tutorial blog.Watercolored Design Studio Blog LayoutIn this tutorial you will learn how to make a clean and simple watercolor design studio layout for a blog.Photoshop Portfolio Web Design TutorialsPortfolio websites are really popular these days and most people working with creative freelance service have an online portfolio for showing off work and skills.

You would have to contact your hosting provider, provision new servers, configure them, get them online and get them integrated and communicating with each other via a load balancer or some other approach.   This isn’t going to happen in 15 minutes.

While there are existing frameworks which address this area, such as one of the many Dependency Injection frameworks, they tend to be much broader in scope, and therefore more complicated to use.

Once you accept that fact, you can do something about it.  There are bugs in every piece of software with even a minimal level of complexity.  Various options exist to address these.  Manual testing is one, but it is often hard to reproduce, or just isn’t done.   Automated testing is also possible, and useful, particularly with regards to test driven development.  But even this has problems because poorly written tests require debugging themselves.  In short, there is NO silver bullet.  There are, however, more tools available.

HEY!Make your own professional looking website in minutes without learning any code at all!Click to get started!You can do it...honestYou don't need to spend money on computer programs or enroll in expensive courses to learn how to make a website. Although HTML, the code for making webpages, may look complicated, it's quite easy to learn. In fact it's easier than learning how to use web design software. Really, it is, and you are about to find that out. So are you ready to make yourfirst webpage? Sure you are, let's get started.Getting down to businessThe only thing needed to make a website is a browser and a simple wordprocessor such as Notepad. Yup, Notepad, even for fancy pancy websites. You Macheads can use Simple Text.Access Notepad  by clicking Start > All Programs > Accessories > NotepadBefore embarking on making your first webpage you need to know how to turn a regular text file into an HTML file: From the File menu in Notepad choose Save As, give your file a name, any name you like, for example mypage, and add the .html extension to it like so:mypage.htmlThe .html extension is what turns a regular text file into an HTML file. It only needs to be addedat the time you create the file, once it's made you simply save it because Notepad will already know that it's an HTML file. Save your file in a folder where you can easily find it. The saved code can be opened and edited from within the word processor, make sure that \"All Files\" is selected from the drop down menu in the processor's dialog box. To open the webpage in your browser simply go to the folder in which it is saved and click on the webpage icon.Important NoteThe file name for the main web page of any website must be index.html All other pageswithin a site can be given any name you like.Now that you know that you're ready to begin your web design course with  Lesson 1--- Ad ---Laptop Batteries at Factory prices and Same Day Shipping!Would you like to put ads on your site too and earn money?

(Check out that link, it's my portfolio and pricing. If you're interested, contact me)Introduction          If you go to google.com and search for �website tutorial�, �website design tutorial�, �how to design a website�, chances are you won�tbe able to find a result that will take you from the beginning of the design process, to the end of the html process. And that isexactly what I�m going to do in this elaborate design tutorial, and for free! Also check out my new article how to make a website at my other site after you finish reading this.Not only am I going to cover every step in detail, but also provide the reasoning and principles behind the decisions I make. Otherdesign tutorials out there only focus on the instruction aspect, but to truly become a better designer you have to understand the principles and concepts that go into effective website design. All of these principles will help you understand how to make a website.I have over 8 years design experience (web and print) and to give back to the community I started these design tutorials. I knowhow difficult it is when you really want to design a great looking site, but simply have no idea where to start because of the hugelack of quality tutorials. I would have figured 8 years down the road there would be a lot of great sources from which to learn, butthere simply isn�t. So I guess I will try to provide a great source that many people can find value in.  Also, feel free to read my free guide about how to make money online.The Project : SiteVerdict.comI figured since I�m going to be taking the time out to write an elaborate tutorial, I might as well try to kill 2 birds with 1 stone. So Ithought of an idea for a website that I thought was somewhat unique, that I could potentially make a buck or two off of.  I came upwith SiteVerdict.com, and it is the site that I will be documenting in this tutorial.  It�s a simplistic web 2.0 design, but both looks greatand is very easy to use and understand.The idea behind the site is to provide a service that allows designers / webmasters receive quality feedback and reviews abouttheir websites, in order to make improvements - and ultimately increase earning potentials. In order to post your website for review, you have to either (a) review X number of sites, or (b) pay $X to skip the process of reviewing other sites.This has been done before, but not successfully. There are webmaster forums that have forums designated specifically for website review and critiquing, but having a full site dedicated to is far more ideal in terms of review/feedback quality and accuracy.Website Design PrinciplesMany webmasters wish they could design great looking sites, but simply can�t. They�ve given it a few attempts, but either due to lackof application knowledge (with apps like photoshop), or lack of �artistic talent�, they give up. And that�s fine, because it keeps the market for design healthy! ;)  But no, it really doesn�t have to be like that.  If you�re an aspiring designer, there are a few key principles that I want to outline first. They are what helped me through my path to becoming a good designer, and they should helpyou too if you follow them.It�s not the 90�s anymoreWhen the early pioneers of the internet age began designing websites in the 90�s, they became fixated on the filters offeredby programs like Photoshop. Lens flares, bevels, drop shadows, glows, were used to their fullest extent. You need to avoid abusing these filters, or I should say, you need to avoid misusing these filters. There are instances in which these filters canbe a great benefit, but you have to know how to use them properly and not just slap them on anything and everything.Usability, Not clutterUsability is all about making the visitor�s experience a good one on your site. Things should be easy to read, easy to accessand most importantly, easy to understand. When a visitor visits your site, they should know exactly what your site is aboutwithin the first couple seconds. This is obviously where design, and layout come into play. You need to avoid cluttering yoursite in the physical sense. I�m not talking about having �too much content�, but rather how you choose to display that content.Things should be laid out with spacing and margins.Text Do's and Dont'sOne of the really big fads that was prevalent in the early part of this decade, was the use of small fonts. I was one of those idiots because I thought it �looked� cool. But for all practical purposes, I always scorn people for using size 10px or less forfonts. Never go below 11px font - and even 11px should only be used sparingly. Size 14px (which is what this is) seems most ideal for paragraph�s of text.  You can get away with 12px of course, but as screen resolutions are increasing, 12px suddenly becomes smaller.Line-height is very important. Line-height is the spacing between each line of text in your paragraphs. Standard line-heightI find is a tad bit too thin, and I like to expand it a little more.  It makes it easier for people to read.Colors and ContrastThe color theme of a site is obviously important. A lot of aspiring designers have a tenancy to use too many colors, simplybecause they�re there. But I like using no more than 2 primary colors and a third �secondary� color that I will use sparingly throughout the design. A simple color theme is easier on the eyes, easier to �comprehend� and overall just looks better. Of course there are exceptions to this, but 9 times out of 10, it�s always better to keep the color theme simple.The color theme also needs to connect with the visitors and the purpose of the site. For example, I wouldn�t use blue andflorescent green/yellow for a site about health - it simply doesn�t make sense and I think that�s a given. :)Contrast is hugely important. It�s very important that your content and navigation are correctly contrasted. The foregroundtext needs to either be very dark, or very light in comparison with the background color. I see a lot of sites where the textwill be a light gray and the background is white - err! That�s very annoying and hard to read.Design around the purpose of the siteA lot of designers, those experienced and not, always use the same �formula� for layout and design elements. To reallymake an impressive and effective site, you need to fully understand what the purpose of the site is, and what the goalsare. Whether the site is based around selling memberships, or just general ad-based content - the design should catermost effectively to the purpose. And that�s what I will be demonstrating in the tutorial proceeding this page.Learn by exampleA common mistake for the aspiring designer is thinking they should be able to open up photoshop, and design a great looking site on their first try. Nope, doesn�t happen like that. You wouldn�t pick up a guitar and start writing music withoutfirst learning a few songs right? Right, and it should be no different for web design.  I recommend that beginners simplytry to recreate existing designs that they think look good. If you do this a few times, it will (1) help you learn the application,(2) help you become a better designer. You subconsciously learn when you recreate an existing design. You automaticallypick up design sense when you do this, and it really helps and goes a long way when it comes down to designing your ownsites.I could probably go on a little bit, which I will cover in future articles but I�m probably boring most of you by now :).
